A **Recent** deck lists notes added in the past week, tags that appear frequently are promoted to their own smart decks automatically, a **Frequent** deck surfaces cards you've opened several times, an **Unseen** deck shows cards you haven't viewed yet, and a **Stale** deck highlights notes you haven't opened in a month.

## Graph View
Toggle the graph button to visualize card connections. Cards are arranged using a force-directed layout; drag nodes to rearrange and their positions are saved locally.

## Suggestions
Related web suggestions provide quick actions to add, edit, ignore or view each item.

The app can be installed as a PWA and works offline thanks to the included service worker. Use the accent, background, text color pickers, and font selector in the header to customize both light and dark themes.

## Web Clipper
The optional browser extension sends the current page, selection, and a screenshot to the local server. Provide an API token for authenticated uploads. Clips are stored locally when offline and uploaded once connectivity is restored.
